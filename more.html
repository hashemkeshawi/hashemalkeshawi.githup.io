			<p id="fText">To be a new student was a very good experience,
			as a student in software development,
			the first year at the College of Computer Science is the most important experiment for academic life, 
			and an introduction to being a software developer.
			<br>
			<br>
			After my first year in college, I had sufficient knowledge of programming study skills,
			and this helps me to continue my studies and achieve my dream.

			<p id="sText">It was a very difficult choice leaveing college and start 
			studying programming and development without a college degree.
			<br>
			<br>
			On the other hand, studying programming from specialized software
			development resources can give the programmer or student 
			the knowledge and the abilitys to do things that the college
			can take a long time and a lot of money to teach.</p>
